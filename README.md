## Overview
A Java-based application for managing and calculating student grades. It reads course data from files, calculates final grades using weighted categories, assigns letter grades, and outputs class statistics.

## Features
- Reads and writes course data via files
- Calculates final and letter grades (Aâ€“F scale)
- Generates class statistics: average, minimum, maximum
- Follows OOP principles: encapsulation and inheritance

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/sayuj1998/Grade-Management-System
```
2. Compile and run:
```
javac GradeManagementSystem.java  
java GradeManagementSystem
```
## Customization ##
After compiling and running the program, you can modify the following details to suit your needs:
* Course Names: Update course titles (e.g., CS1050, CS2040) to any course of your choice.
* Instructor Details: Change the instructor's name and email.
* Student Names: Edit student names (e.g., Stack Exception, Binary Beast) to represent any students.
* Grading Categories: Adjust grading components (e.g., Participation, Quizzes, Final Exam) and their weight percentages.
* Grade Inputs: Modify individual student grades for each category to see updated final results.
* Letter Grade Ranges: Update the grading scale if a different grading system is required.
